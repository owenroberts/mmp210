<div class="slide">
	<h2>Getting started</h2>
	<p>Using GitHub as a publishing tool helps us do a few things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Learn git!  This is a very valuable and marketable tool.</li>
		<li>Collaborate easily.</li>
		<li>Publish simple webpages online for free.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Sign up at <a href="http://github.com" target="blank">GitHub.com</a></p>
	<img src="github_old/signup.png">
	<p>Use an email you can check, you will have to confirm your email.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We are going to start with the GitHub Desktop client to learn the basics of git and Github.</p>
	<p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="blank">Download the GitHub Desktop Client here.</a></p>
	<p>The lab computers may have an older version that looks a bit different but they have most of the same functionality.</p>
	<p>Follow the steps to login to your account:</p>

	<p>Once logged in, use the + button in the upper left to add a new repo.</p>
	<p>Repo is short for <code>code repository</code>.</p>
	<p>Select your <code>mmp210</code> folder.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="github_old/uncommitted.png" alt="">
	<p>Since this is our first update to the git repository all of our files are green meaning they're new changes to be added.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="github_old/initial.png" alt="">
	<p>Write a commit message and then click the commit to master button.</p>
	<p>Once your first commit is made, you can click the <note>Publish</note> button.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="github_old/change.png" alt="">
	<p>After the first commit, new changes or additions to your folder will show in the Github Desktop window.  When you are done with a new assignment or project, you will write a new commit message and use the <note>Sync</note> button to upload it to Github.</p>
	<p>This process takes the place of the FTP client that was used in MMP 100.  This is a more effective way to publish a website because it tracks all of our changes.  Just like you have previously done with FTP and Filezilla, you can use GitHub Desktop on your home computer and when you sign in you will be able to create a copy or <code>clone</code> of your project on any computer.  You can then upload and download your changes without worrying about losing any work.  <note>Remember to always Sync before editing your files and commit when you're done.</note></p>
