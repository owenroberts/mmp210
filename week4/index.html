	<p>One of the essential components of computer based art is the possibility for interaction.</p>
	<p>Interactive design gives the user the ability to influence the design.  Sometimes the changes are small, sometimes they are large -- the artist has the ability to control how much the user can change.</p>
	<p>In JavaScript, we use <em>events</em> to detect when a user interacts with a program.  We can detect things like mouse movement, mouse clicks, key board inputs and change in orientation or touches in mobile devices.  Today we'll start with some simple interactions.</p>
