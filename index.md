# Schedule

## Week 1: Intro to JavaScript, p5.js

- [HTML / CSS Review notes](week1/)
- [Intro to p5](week1/p5.html)
- [GitHub Publishing](week1/github.html)
- In class assignment
	- Create a simple web site to use as the portfolio page for your work this semester.
	- Your site should have at least one of each:
		- Image
		- Stylesheet
		- Menu, with links
- Assignment 1
	- Draw a self-portrait using p5
	- Use the shape and color functions
	- Be creative, try to show us something about yourself through drawing and design

## Week 2: Statements, operators & variables

- [JavaScript statements, operators & variables](week2/)
- [p5 color, stroke, fill](week2/p5.html)
- Assignment 2
	- Using p5, create a design that uses variables as the arguments for the drawing functions.
	- Drawing functions include fill(), stroke(), rect(), line(), ellipse(), triangle() etc...
	- There should be at least 5 colors and 5 shapes.

```
fill(0); // this is hard coded
 var c = color(255,0,255);
 fill(c); // this uses the variable 'c'
```
