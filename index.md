## Class Description
This course introduces the basic concepts of programming for multimedia. Students will learn the principles of object-oriented programming and how to create scripts for the manipulation of graphics, audio and text to construct a web-based multimedia presentation. 

In addition to the above, the current version of this course focuses on creating interactive art and learning basic programming concepts using JavaScript along with the [p5 JavaScript library](https://p5js.org/){:target="_blank"}.

## Turning in assignments
