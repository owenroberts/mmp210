## Week 9 **Pattern**
- [Generating patterns](notes/pattern)

## Midterm **Generative design**
- Create a concept for a product that will have a generative pattern design
- Choose a theme that will inform your design
- Create a sketch that generates new patterns based on a theme, a new pattern each time the user clicks
- Use `save` to save images and choose 3 to print and present to the class
- The sketch must use variables, a for loop, colors, and shapes
- Use a series of decisions (if, else) or randomly generated values to change the pattern
- Write a short, 3-4 sentence description of the project, for example: *I'm designing a pattern for socks.  My theme is Spring and I'm using a polka dot pattern.  I chose different shades of green for the background to represent  the new leaves on the trees.  I also chose pinks and purples for foreground shapes to represent flowers.*
