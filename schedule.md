[Home](index.html) [Schedule](schedule.html)

## Week 1
**Intro to JavaScript, p5.js**

- [HTML / CSS Review notes](week1/)
- [Intro to p5](week1/p5.html)
- [GitHub Publishing](week1/github.html)
- <a href="https://owenbmcc.github.io/classwork210/week1/" target="blank">Class example</a>
- In class assignment
	- Create a simple web site to use as the portfolio page for your work this semester.
	- Your site should have at least one of each:
		- Image
		- Stylesheet
		- Menu, with links
- **Assignment 1**
	- Draw a self-portrait using p5
	- Use the shape and color functions
	- Be creative, try to show us something about yourself through drawing and design

## Week 2
**Statements, operators & variables**

- [JavaScript statements, operators & variables](week2/)
- [p5: color, stroke, fill](week2/p5.html)
	- [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
- [Code academy review](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/getting-started-v2)
- <a href="https://owenbmcc.github.io/classwork210/week2/" target="blank">Class example</a>
- **Assignment 2**
	- Using p5, create a design that uses variables as the arguments for the drawing functions.
	- Drawing functions include fill(), stroke(), rect(), line(), ellipse(), triangle() etc...
	- There should be at least 5 colors and 5 shapes.
	- You can draw whatever you like, but if you are having trouble deciding what to draw, try choosing something from an activity you like, maybe an instrument like drums, a soccer or basket ball, a skateboard or anything else that represents something you like to do.
	- Variables are useful for reusing information.  Think of ways to manipulate variables to use the same data repetitively.
	- [p5 example](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/owenroberts/sketches/r1Z8cxbFx)

```
// don't use hardcoded values
fill(0);

// make a variable first
var c = color(255,0,255);
fill(c); // this uses the variable 'c'
```

## Week 3
**Debugging**
- [JavaScript debugging](week3/)
- [p5: text](week3/p5.html)
- [Debugging challenge](week3/debug.zip)
- <a href="https://owenbmcc.github.io/classwork210/week3/" target="blank">Class example</a>
- **Assignment 3**
	- Make a logo design with your name
	- Use text and other shapes
	- Drawing and text functions must use variables


## Week 4
**Logic**
- [JavaScript comparison operators and conditionals](week4/)
- [GitHub client](week4/github.html)
- [p5 system variables](week4/p5.html)
- **Assignment 4**
	- Create a design that uses system variables to change the color of the shapes being drawn
	- The color should change over time or space
	- Time can be measured with `frameCount`
	- Space is measured with `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `width` and `height`
	- Examples
		- [Tickle](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-tickle.html)
		- [Follow](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-follow-1.html)

- [Objects](https://owenroberts.github.io/mmp210/week10/)

**Week 11: Interaction**
- [Interaction](https://owenroberts.github.io/mmp210/week11/)
- Final requirements
	- The final project is making an interactive design
	- Choose a new theme to inform design choices, like shape, color and pattern
	- Designs can be abstract, represtational or combination
	- Each program must use:
		- variables
		- if ... else logic statement
		- at least one for loop
		- at least one defined function
		- shape and color functions
		- user input
		- animation
		- image
	- User input can be mouse, keyboard, HTML elements, or a combination
	- [p5 examples for inspiration](https://p5js.org/gallery/)
