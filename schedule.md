## Project 1 **Self Portrait**
- Over the next three weeks you will make a self portrait, starting with a simple drawing and ending with an interactive artwork using variables.
- One version due each week.  The three versions include a hard coded drawing, a static drawing with variables, an interactive version.
- We will give feedback in class.  Part of the evaluation is writing down feedback and using it to make changes to the self portrait.  It could be as simple as changing a color or moving a line.
- Each version should have it's own URL added to the GitHub Pages home page and submitted via Blackboard.
- Giving feedback is part of the assignment.

## Week 2 **Shape & Color**

## Week 11 **Keyboard + Sound**
- [Keyboard interaction](notes/keyboard)
- [Sound](notes/sound)
- **Assignment 11: Keyboard Sampler**
	- Combine sounds with keyboard events to create a sound sampler

## Week 12 **Interaction 2**
- [Functions](notes/functions)
- [Interaction 2](notes/interaction_2)

## **Final Proposal**
- Presentation sketch
- Choose a previous project to elaborate on or propose something new, hybrid
- How will user interact with sketch?
- What type of graphics will be used?

## Final Project
- p5 sketch
- User interaction (with sketch variables or DOM elements or both)
- At least one external file (image or sound)
- Use variables
- Use at least one example of logic (if statement)
- Use at least one of loop or function

## Midterm **Generative design**
- Create a concept for a product that will have a generative pattern design
- Choose a theme that will inform your design
- Create a sketch that generates new patterns based on a theme, a new pattern each time the user clicks
- Use `save` to save images and choose 3 to print and present to the class
- The sketch must use variables, a for loop, colors, and shapes
- Use a series of decisions (if, else) or randomly generated values to change the pattern
- Write a short, 3-4 sentence description of the project, for example: *I'm designing a pattern for socks.  My theme is Spring and I'm using a polka dot pattern.  I chose different shades of green for the background to represent  the new leaves on the trees.  I also chose pinks and purples for foreground shapes to represent flowers.*
