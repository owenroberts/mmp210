## Week 1 **Intro**
- [HTML](notes/html) & [CSS](notes/css) Review 
- [GitHub Publishing](notes/github)
- **Assignment 1: Portolfio web page**
	- Create a simple web site to use as the portfolio page for your work this semester

		- Image
		- Stylesheet
		- Menu, with links

## Project 1 **Self Portrait**
- Over the next three weeks you will make a self portrait, starting with a simple drawing and ending with an interactive artwork using variables.
- One version due each week.  The three versions include a hard coded drawing, a static drawing with variables, an interactive version.
- We will give feedback in class.  Part of the evaluation is writing down feedback and using it to make changes to the self portrait.  It could be as simple as changing a color or moving a line.
- Each version should have it's own URL added to the GitHub Pages home page and submitted via Blackboard.
- Giving feedback is part of the assignment.

## Week 2 **Shape & Color**
