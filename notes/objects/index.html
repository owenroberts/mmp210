<div class="slide">
	<p>Although we haven't talked about them specifically, we have been using objects all semester.  In fact, basically everything in JavaScript is an object, including arrays, functions, and anything that has methods or properties.</p>
	<p>JavaScript is based on an object oriented programming design.  This means the language is organized around objects and data rather than logic and actions.</p>
	<p>Simply put, and object is a collection of properties and methods associated with one, well, object.  Properties and methods and described with key value pairs.</p>

	<p>Properties and methods are assigned with key value pairs.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Key, value pairs</h2>
	<p>In a key value pair, the key is a string and the value can be any JavaScript value, a number, string, array, function or another object.</p>
	<table class="code">
		<tr>
			<th>key</th>
			<th>value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>color</td>
			<td>"blue"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>speed</td>
			<td>60</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>isOnTime</td>
			<td>true</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>Single values like numbers, strings and booleans are called <note>properties</note>, while functions are called <note>methods</note>.</p>

	<h2>Train Object</h2>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Almost any object in the real world can be used as a metaphor for a JavaScript object.  Let's use trains.</p>
	<p>Like objects in the real world, JavaScript objects have properties and methods, or qualities and actions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Trains all have one basic blueprint.  This is like the object.</p>
	<p>A train has many properties, such as color, speed, number of passengers, distance traveled, origin and ending locations, etc.</p>
	<p>It also has actions, like functions, it moves on tracks, it honks it's horn, it carries passengers.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Constructor</h2>
	<p>Objects can be declared in several ways.  One is using the function keyword with object notation.  In this case the name of the function is capitalized.  This doesn't have a functional purpose, but it is a visual cue that we are creating an object rather than a function.</p>
	<p>This is a train <code>constructor</code> which is like a blueprint for a default train.  We can build trains based on this model and then modify their properties.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>// constructor
function Train() {
	this.color = "blue";
	this.speed = 100;
	this.numberOfPassengers = 400;
	this.distance = 25;
	this.origin = "New York";
	this.destination = "Boston";
	this.getDuration = function() {
		return this.distance / this.speed;
	};
}

// create a train
var mta = new Train();
console.log(mta);
console.log('duration', mta.getDuration());

// update train properties
mta.color = "red";
mta.distance = 100;
console.log(mta);</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>Like function, objects can take arguments.</p>
	<p>Arguments can be used to add variations to the objects when they are <note>instantiated</note> (created).</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function Train(color, distance, origin, destination) {
	this.color = color;
	this.distance = distance;
	this.origin = origin;
	this.destination = destination;
}
var njTransit = new Train("orange", 200, "Penn Station", "Trenton");
console.log(njTransit);</div>
</div>
