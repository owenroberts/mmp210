	<p>JavaScript understands a few different types of text.</p>
	<table>

			<td><note>keywords</note></td> 
			<td>words like <code>function</code> and <code>var</code> that are defined by the language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><note>variable names</note></td> 
			<td>words for functions and variables that we create in our code like <code>faceSize</code> and <code>faceColor</code>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><note>hard data</note></td> 
			<td>numbers and words that represent values like <code>0</code> or a string like <code>"hello world"</code>.</td>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Variables are placeholders in the computers memory that we give a nickname and store some data in.</p>
	<p>If we assign a variable called <code>faceSize</code> the number <code>50</code> we can later use it to draw a face and that value will be used.</p>
	<p>We can change the value later.  That's why it is known as a variable.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Variables are kind of like names for people.</p>
	<p>Imagine a story involving three of your friends.  It might go something like this: Jerry and Jenny went to the park one day and met their friend Nick.</p>
	<p>This story would make sense to you if you know who Jerry, Jenny and Nick are.  It wouldn't make as much sense if you didn't know them.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We use names to make it easy to refer to people.  I wouldn't have to specify which student I was calling on by using their CUNY id.  That would be too hard to memorize.  It would also be difficult to call on students based on what seat their sitting in.  Third row from the back, 3 seats down is not an easy way to call on someone.</p>
	<p>Variables, like names, make it easier to understand what's happening in our code.</p>
	<p>The value <code>50</code> could be used for anything.  But the variable <code>faceSize</code> is pretty clear in terms of what it should be used for in the sketch.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Using variables</h2>
	<p>In the last class we drew a self portrait, using <note>hardcoded</note> values.  A hardcoded value is a number or string written directly into the program.  It will not change unless you rewrite it.  Let's take a look at that program:</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>// self portrait 
function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200);
	background(220);
	
	noStroke();
	fill("plum");
	ellipse(100, 100, 100); // face

	fill("yellow");
	ellipse(75, 100, 25); // right eye
	ellipse(125, 100, 25); // left eye

	noFill();
	stroke("#ffddff");
	strokeWeight(4);
	rect(75, 125, 50, 10, 10); // mouth	
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We can improve this program using variables. Notice I used the same size for the eyes width in my self portrait?  I can use one variable to save that value and adjust both eyes at one time:</p>
	<pre><code>var eyeSize = 25;
ellipse(75, 100, eyeSize); // right eye
ellipse(125, 100, eyeSize); // left eye</code></pre>
</div> 

<div class="slide">
	<p>This improves the program in a couple of ways.</p>
	<p>First, it's easier to update.  If I want the eyes larger, I change one variable, which is easy to identify, and assign it to a different number.</p>
	<p>Second, it's much easier to read.  I know that the eyeSize is the third argument in each ellipse function, so I can guess that it's drawing the eyes.</p>
	<p>Third, it will make the values easier to change or update, which we will start doing next week.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We can also do this with colors, or string values.  My self portrait uses hardcoded values for colors: <code>"plum"</code>, <code>"yellow"</code> and <code>"#ffddff"</code>.  If I want to change the color of any of the parts of the face I need to rewrite this.  If I use a variable instead, I can change all of the shapes using each color and change them all at the same time.</p>
	<p>If I want to add to the eyes using the same color as the face this will be useful.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>// self portrait 
function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200);
	background(220);

	var eyeSize = 25;
	var faceColor = "plum";
	
	noStroke();
	fill(faceColor);
	ellipse(100, 100, 100); // face

	fill("yellow");
	ellipse(75, 100, eyeSize); // right eye
	ellipse(125, 100, eyeSize); // left eye

	fill(faceColor);
	ellipse(75, 100, eyeSize / 2); // right pupil
	ellipse(125, 100, eyeSize / 2); // left pupil

	noFill();
	stroke("#ffddff");
	strokeWeight(4);
	rect(75, 125, 50, 10, 10); // mouth	
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Notice I also used <code>eyeSize / 2</code> for the size of both pupils.  Now they are relative to the size of the eyes.  I can update both eyes and pupils by changing one color.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Keep in mind that the string <code>"plum"</code> has to have quotation marks around it because it is hard data.  <code>faceColor</code> does not have quotation marks because it's a variable.</p>
</div>
