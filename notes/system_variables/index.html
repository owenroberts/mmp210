	<h2>setup and draw</h2>
	<p>Before we look at system variables, let's review <code>setup</code> and <code>draw</code>, because we'll need them in our lesson.</p>
	<p><a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup" target="blank">setup</a> is called <strong>once</strong> when the page loads, and defines some initial variables and does other things we only want to do once, like loading image data, or perhaps setting the background color.</p>
	<p><a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw" target="blank">draw</a> after <code>setup</code> is done, <code>draw</code> will loop continuously (unless <code>noLoop</code> is called) until the browser window is closed.  Every line inside of the <code>draw</code> function will be called in order everytime it runs, by default at 60 FPS (frames-per-second).</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>var x = 1;
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(255);

    fill('plum');
    rect(150, 150, 100, 100); // only gets drawn once
}
function draw() {
// 	background(255); // remove comment
	x++;
	fill('white');
	ellipse(x, 200, 100);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p><span class="note">A quick note on scope:</span> We'll talk about scope in more detail later in the semester, but at this point it's important to understand that in order for a variable to be used by both <code>setup</code> and <code>draw</code>, it must be declared outside of both functions, usually at the beginning of our program.</p>

	<h2>Static system variables</h2>
	<p>Some basic variables will stay the same throughout the lifetime of your sketch</p>
	<p><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are static variables that are set to the width and height of the sketch, which is <code>100 x 100</code> by default or whatever is set in <code>createCanvas</code>.</p>
	<p>Try changing the values in <code>createCanvas</code> to see the canvas change sizes.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200);
	background(220);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Whatever arguments are used for <code>createCanvas</code> also become the values of <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.</p>
	<p>Those values can be used to draw shapes relative to the size of the canvas.  Try changing the values in <code>createCanvas</code> again and see the ellipse shape change as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200);
	background(220);
	ellipse(width/2, height/2, width);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The ellipse is drawn in the middle of the canvas and fills up the width of the canvas.  The x position is calculated by dividing width in half, while the y position is calculated by dividing height in half.  The size of the ellipse is the same as the width of the canvas.</p>
	<p>Let's rewrite this example using variables to make it clear what we're doing.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200);
	background(220);
	var x = width/2;
	var y = height/2;
	var d = width; // diameter
	ellipse(x, y, d);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Even though the variables are not necessary for the code to work, it makes it clear that we are defining the x position of the ellipse based on the width of the canvas, and likewise with y position and diameter of the circle.</p>
	<p>This example uses rectangles to make a checker pattern.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() {
	createCanvas(200, 200);
	background(220);
	noStroke();
	fill('plum');
	
	var x = 0;
	var y = 0;
	var w = width/2;  // width
	var h = height/2; // height
	rect(x, y, w, h);

	x = width/2;
	y = height/2;
	rect(x, y, w, h);
}</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<p>I'm setting x and y to start and then changing them for the second rectangle.  The width and height variables stay the same.  I can redefine my x and y variables or width and height as many times as I need to.</p>
	<p>Let's use <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> to draw a simple grid.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function setup() {
	createCanvas(640, 360);
	background("white");
	stroke("plum");
	strokeWeight(2);

	// line down the middle of the canvas from top to bottom
	var x1 = width/2;
	var y1 = 0;
	var x2 = width/2;
	var y2 = height;
	line(x1, y1, x2, y2);

	// line across the middle of the canvas from left to right
	x1 = 0;
	y1 = height/2;
	x2 = width;
	y2 = height/2;
	line(x1, y1, x2, y2);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Dynamic system variables</h2>
	<p>Some system variables change over time.  <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> change everytime you move your mouse.  They represent the position of the mouse in the p5 canvas.</p>
	<p>To capture those values over time, we need to use a draw loop to capture the movement of our mouse by running the program every frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function draw() {
	background("white");
	strokeWeight(2);
	fill("plum");

	// draw line between the mouse position and origin point
	var x = mouseX;
	var y = mouseY;
	line(x, y, 0, 0);

	// draw circle at mouse position
	ellipse(x, y, 40);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>In the previous example, the ellipse and line move differently but always share one point.</p>
	<p>The line has two points, one is tethered to the bottom right corner of the canvas.  The ellipse has a point for the center and then a size, so the whole shape moves with the mouse.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>p5 also has <code>pmouseX</code> and <code>pmouseY</code> values that keep track of where you mouse was last.</p>
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function draw() {
	background("white");
	strokeWeight(2);
	fill("plum");

	// draw ellipse at previous mouse position
	var x = pmouseX;
	var y = pmouseY;
	var s = 40; // size
	ellipse(x, y, 40);
	
	// draw line between current and previous mouse position
	line(mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY);
	
	// draw ellipse at current mouse position
	x = mouseX;
	y = mouseY;
	ellipse(x, y, s/2); // half the size
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The <code>frameCount</code> value is of frames frames the program has run, or how many times it has been drawn.  It goes up by one for every frame.  It's sort of like our earlier example where we incremented <code>x++</code> every frame.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-preview>function draw() {
	background(220);

	// using frameCount as the ellipse size
	var x = width/2;
	var y = height/2;
	var s = frameCount; // size
	ellipse(x, y, s);
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Note that all of those variables work without us writing something like <code>var frameCount = 0;</code> or definining the variables.</p>
	<p>This is part of what p5 does for us, it creates functions like <code>ellipse</code> and variables like <code>width</code> which make it easier to interact with the environment and focus on our code and composition over techinical aspects of the browser and the Canvas API.</p>
