<div class="slide">
	<p>JavaScript is a programming language, created in 1995, specifically designed to work with websites, meaning browsers and web pages built with HTML and CSS.</p>
	<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the core technologies that every web page is built with.</p>
	<p>For more on history and workings of JavaScript I highly recommend <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript" target="blank">What is JavaScript?</a> on MDN, as well as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY" target="blank">Crockford on JavaScript</a> lecture series by Douglas Crockford, one of the architects of the language.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>One thing we should clear up right now:</p>
	<p><em>JavaScript is not Java</em>.</p> 
	<p>It has no relationship to Java.  They are completely separate languages that happen to have similar sounding names.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Now that we've cleared that up, let's talk about what JavaScript is.</p>
	<p>JavaScript is the scripting language packaged with all web browsers.  It adds functionality to sites that isn't covered by HTML and CSS.</p>
	<p>We reviewed HTML and CSS, and I'm going to assume everyone is familiar with what a web browser, but in case that's not the case, let's pause for a moment and talk about what a web browser is.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>The JavaScript console</h2>
	<p>Because every browser uses JavaScript, we can write JavaScript without even opening a text editor or creating a file.  We can start writing JavaScript directly in the browser window you currently have open, by using the JavaScript console.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>For this class I will be using the Google Chrome browser.  To open the console in Chrome, you can use the shorcut <em>Command + Alt + J</em> on Mac or <em>Control + Shift + J</em> or use the toolbar menu and go to <em>View > Developer > JavaScript Console</em>.</p>
	<div class="key">CAj</div> on Mac
	<div class="key">VSj</div> on Windows
	<p>If you're on another browser you can either Google how to open the console or switch to Chrome.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The console is an awesome tool for developers.  We can type JavaScript code directly into the console and it will immediately be evaluated.  Try something simple just to see it work.</p>
	<p>Type an expression into the console and then hit <span class="key">R</span> <code>(Enter)</code> to see it be evaluated.</p>
	<pre><code><c></c> 2 + 2
// 4</code></pre>
	<p>So JavaScript can do basic arithmetic.  Cool.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The console is used mostly for debugging, which is a process that developers do when something in their code is not doing what they want it to do.  The console is useful for evaluating statements and functions and sending messages from the code to the console, where the developer can see it, but the user typically would not.</p>
	<p>We'll talk more about debugging in a later lesson.</p>
	<p>For now, we're just going to use the console to demonstrate some of the properties and possibilities of JavaScript.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Expressions</h2>

	<p><code>2 + 2</code> is a simple JavaScript expression.  JavaScript interprets the expression and returns a result.  This is a very simple version of everything that happens in a computer program.  The programmer asks the computer to evaluate a series of expressions and statements and the computer returns a result.</p>
	<p>Programming languages are sort of like Google Translates for people and computers.  It translates the idea we want into something the computer can understand.</p>
