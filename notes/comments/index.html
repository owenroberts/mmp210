	<h2>Comments</h2>
	<p>In code, comments are sections of the program that are not read by the compiler.  Different languages use different conventions to separate comments within the language of the program.  These are used by developers to note what the code is doing for other developers or for future reference.</p>
	<p>It's extremely important to comment your code with useful comments.</p>
	<p>In HTML, a comment can be written using this syntax:</p>
	<pre><code>&lt;!--  COMMENT TEXT GOES HERE --></code></pre>
	<p>In CSS, comments use this syntax:</p>
	<pre><code>/* COMMENT IS HERE */</code></pre>
