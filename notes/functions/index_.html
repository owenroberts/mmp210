<div class="slide">
	<p>Functions are blocks of code that can be called repeatedly.  Functions are defined like variables but have parentheses following the function name. The parentheses <code>()</code> are an operator like <code>+</code> or <code>=</code> that are used to <note>invoke</note> or call a function.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>There a two primary ways to create a function.</p>
	<pre><code>// function declaration
function foo() {
	console.log("Hello :)");
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// function statement 
var bar = function() {
	console.log("world");
}; // ends with semi color because it's a statement</code></pre>
	<p>Notice how nothing happens after we declare the function.  The function is defined, but the code won't run until it is called:</p>
	<pre><code>foo();
bar();</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The function in the previous example isn't very useful.  We can just as easily write out <code>console.log("world");</code> as we can <code>foo()</code>.  Even if there were more lines, if they only do one thing, it's not that useful.  A function should repeat a series of code that needs to be done often, and usually called from different parts of the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>A function can also be written with <note>arguments</note>, which are variables that are declared within the parentheses of the function.</p>
	<p>Think of a function like a machine that has a series of actions.  For example, a car can drive from one place to another, as many times as you want it to.  But that's not very useful if there's no one in the car.  You can put anyone you want to in a car and take them wherever you want.  If we think of a car as a function it has many possible inputs: people, an origin and destination, the amount of gas, speed, radio channel, etc.  And these input have a result.  People are carried from one place to another.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Let's write a function with arguments.</p>
	<pre><code>function greet(name, greeting) {
	console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
}

greet("Jenny", "Hello");
greet("Jerry", "Hi");</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Now check what happens if we call the function with out arguments:</p>
	<pre><code>greet();</code></pre>
	<p>Why is this <code>undefined, undefined</code>?</p>
	<p>The variables that are created for the arguments of the function, in this case <code>name</code> and <code>greeting</code> and implicitly instantiated when the function is called.</p>
	<p>So, even though we never wrote <code>var name;</code> or <code>var greeting;</code> they are instantiated, and when a variable is instantiated but not assigned, it has the value <code>undefined</code>.  Because we did not call our function with the right number of arguments, those values stay undefined.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Return</h2>
	<p>Functions can also <code>return</code> values.  A return statement stops the function block and returns a value to whatever variable the function is assigned to.</p>
	<pre><code>function add(n1, n2) {
	return n1 + n2;
}
var x = add(2, 2);
var y = add(x, 2);
var z = add(x, y);
console.log(add(x, y, z));</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Scope</h2>
	<p>Variables declared within a function are not available to other functions in our program.  Any variables declared in the <note>global</note> scope, or outside of any function, are available to function scopes.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Bad scope example:</p>
	<pre><code>function assign() {
	var x = 0;
	var y = 1;
}
function add() {
	console.log(x + y);
}
assign();
add();</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Better scope example:</p>
	<pre><code>var z; 
var w;
function assign() {
	z = 0;
	w = 1;
}
function add() {
	console.log(z + w);
}
assign();
add();</code></pre>
