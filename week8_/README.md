[p5 review: nested for loops, random, logic](https://owenroberts.github.io/mmp210/week8/index.html)

**Midterm: Generative design**
- Choose a theme that will inform your design
- Create a sketch that generates new patterns based on a theme
- Each time the sketch is loaded, or website refreshed, a variation of your basic pattern should appear
- The sketch must use variables, a for loop, colors, and shapes
- Use a series of decisions (if, else) or randomly generated values to change the pattern
- Write a short description explaining your choices, 3 - 4 sentences. For example:
  - My theme is Spring and I'm using a polka dot pattern.  I chose different shades of green for the background to represent  the new leaves on the trees.  I also chose pinks and purples for foreground shapes to represent flowers.
