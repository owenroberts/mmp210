			<h1>JavaScript objects</h1>

			<p>Although we haven't talked about them specifically, we have been using objects all semester.  In fact, basically everything in JavaScript is an object, including arrays, functions, and anything that has methods or properties.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is based on an object oriented programming design.  This means the language is organized around objects and data rather than logic and actions.</p>
			<p>Simply put, and object is a collection of properties and methods associated with one, well, object.  Properties and methods and described with key value pairs.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>In a key value pair, the key is a string and the value can be any JavaScript value, a number, string, array, function or another object.  Single values like numbers, strings and booleans are called properties, while functions are called methods.</p>
			<p>For example, with an array object, <code>.length</code> is a property and <code>.push()</code> is a method.  An array is an object that contains key values for each of the elements in the array as well as other methods and properties.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>When we covered functions, I used cars as an example, so this time I'll use trains.</p>
			<p>(But you can use virtually any real world object as an example for a JavaScript object.)</p>
			<p>Like objects in the real world, JavaScript objects have properties and methods, or qualities and actions.</p>
			<p>A train has many properties, such as color, speed, number of passengers, distance traveled, origin and ending locations, etc.</p>
			<p>It also has actions, it moves on tracks, it honks it's horn, it carries passengers.</p>
			<p>Let's create a JavaScript version of a train:</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<pre><code><c></c>var train = {};</code></pre>
			<p>Objects are declared with curly brackets.</p>
			<pre><code><c></c>train.color = "blue";
<c></c>train.speed = 100;
<c></c>train.numberOfPassengers = 400;
<c></c>train.distance = 25;
<c></c>train.origin = "New York";
<c></c>train.destination = "Boston";
<c></c>console.log(train);</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Another way to create a train is using object notation:</p>
			<pre><code><c></c>var train = {
	speed: 60,
	numberOfPassengers: 500,
	distance: 100,
	origin: "Seattle",
	destination: "San Francisco"
};
<c></c>console.log(train);</code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>You can then reference the properties and methods of that train using dot notation:</p>
			<pre><code><c></c>console.log(train.speed);
<c></c>console.log(train.speed / train.distance );</code></pre>
		</div>
        
        <div class="slide">
            <p>Last week we made a fleet of Spaceships by adding a bunch of arrays to track different aspects of the spaceship.  This was good for reducing the number of variables we needed to keep track of the size, position and color of each ship in our fleet, but the more things we change, the more variables we have to create.</p>
            <p>A better way to organize this information is by adding a spaceship object, a single block of code that keeps track of it's own x, y, size and color values and can be added to an array.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide">
            <p>So, instead of several arrays, we can use one array of spaceships:</p>
            <pre><code>var spaceships = [];</code></pre>
            <p>And then define a spaceship objects with each of the properties we used before:</p>
            <pre><code>function Spaceship() {
    this.x = random( 0, width/4 );
    this.y = random( 0, height );
    this.speed = random(1, 3);
    this.size = random(10, 40);
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
        	<p>We will also add methods to the spaceship objects to draw it's shapes and update them:</p>
        	<pre><code>this.draw = function() {
	// all of the shapes we need for the spaceship
}
this.update = function() {
	if (this.x < width) this.x += this.speed;
	else this.x = 0;
}</code></pre>
        </div>
