<h1> M i d t e r m </h1>

	<p> My pattern was inspired by the movie "The Maze Runner" and I'm using the line pattern. The movie had a very serious and monochromatic vibe so I decided to switch it up by using bright colors with different shades of pink and purple. I kept the background simple by using the color white because I didn't want it to conflict with the bright colors. </p>
